  <!-- The original had a branch, a revision and a tag.
       My testing isn't working with branches yet, and the implementation
       of weld doesn't "clone" with a revision and tag yet (it's got a bug,
       specifically it tries to do "git clone -r <rev> -r <tag>" and there
       is no "-r" switch). Also, I'm doubtful that it makes sense to specify
       more than one of branch, revision and tag. Weld currently just chooses
       one (in some internally specified order), but it might be better if
       it refused the weld file in this case (although note that muddle also
       has something of this problem).

    # Summary:
    #
    # Locally, we have made alterations to both 124 and to two-duck
    # Remotely, "someone else" has made alterations to project124
    #
    # So, "pushing" two-duck is relatively simple - we need to fold its
    # changes back into our base igniting_duck, and push that.
    #
    # It's a bit less certain what to do for project124, as there are
    # changes (since the last Merge event) both far and near.
    # Of course, so far as "this end" is concerned, we don't "know" about
    # the far changes yet - they've not been "pulled" into our local 124
    # directory. Maybe that's just an argument for doing "weld pull" before
    # doing "weld push" - much as one should with git itself. If we go
    # with that, then we should perform all the merging on the "visible"
    # side (i.e., in our main directories, not in our .weld/bases),
    # and applying the patch to the .weld/bases/<base> should then Just
    # Work, since any conflicts have already been resolved...
    #
    # Given the above, should we note that a "weld pull" is needed, and
    # tell the user they *must* sort it out before we can allow "weld push"?
    # Can we tell?
    #
    # XXX And don't forget the other thing I've not looked at yet, which
    # XXX is editing the weld.xml file (.weld/welded.xml, I suppose) and
    # XXX wanting to push *that*.
    # XXX
    # XXX For both pulling and pushing, we need to consider (the
    # XXX appropriate end):
    # XXX
    # XXX a) adding a new base or seam to the XML file
    # XXX b) removing a base or seam from the XML file
    # XXX c) changing a seam in the XML file (ick)
    #

    # try pulling it? It is under git control, as is the top-level
