An explanation with diagrams
============================

Clones of our external packages:

.. image:: images/igniting_duck.png
.. image:: images/project124.png

An empty weld, just after doing ``weld init``:

.. image:: images/fromble_empty.png

A representation of the same:

.. image:: images/fromble_L_shaped.png

and a further version of that making it explicit we have no bases yet:

.. image:: images/fromble_empty_bases.png

This is what a user would expect to see after they had done a ``git clone`` of
the weld repository:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_no_bases.png

After doing ``weld pull project124`` they would have:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_base_project124.png

After also doing ``weld pull igniting_duck``, they would have:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_both_bases.png

This is the weld after changing the name of the seam ``one_duck`` to
``one_goose``:

.. image:: images/fromble_one_goose.png

Repositories:

.. image:: images/fromble_repo.png
.. image:: images/project124_repo.png
.. image:: images/igniting_duck_repo.png

This is an alternative way of showing "project124", trying to make it clearer
that it is all of the base that is being included:

.. image:: images/fromble_all_blue.png
