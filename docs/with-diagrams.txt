Weld for those who need to maintain welds
=========================================

Getting the weld command line tool
==================================
Getting weld needs git. If you don't have git on your system, and you're on
a Debian based system (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.), then you can do:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt-get install git gitk

(the ``gitk`` program is an invaluable UI for looking at the state of git
checkouts - it's always worth checking it out as well as git itself).

Then decide where to put weld. I have a ``sw`` directory for useful software
checkouts, so I would do:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd sw
  $ git clone https://code.google.com/p/weld/

which creates me a directory ``~/sw/weld``.

.. note:: Sometimes (luckily not often) the Google code repositories give
   errors. In this case, the only real solution is to try again later.

To *use* weld, you can then either:

1. just type ``~/sw/weld/weld`` - this is the simplest thing to do,
   but the longest to type.

2. add an alias to your ``.bashrc`` or equivalent:

   .. code-block:: bash

      alias weld="${HOME}/sw/weld/weld"

3. add ``~/sw/weld`` to your PATH:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/sw/weld

4. add a link - for instance, if you have ``~/bin`` on your path, do:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cd ~/bin
     $ ln -s ~/sw/weld/weld .

Personally, I use the second option, but all are sensible.

You should now be able to do:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ weld help

and get meaningful output.

Creating a weld
===============
We start with two external packages, project124 and igniting_duck. Here are
their remote repositories:

.. image:: images/project124_repo.png
.. image:: images/igniting_duck_repo.png

We can clone them in the normal manner:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone file://<repo_base>/project124
  $ git clone file://<repo_base>/igniting_duck

which gives us two working directories:

.. image:: images/project124.png
.. image:: images/igniting_duck.png

Each has directories called ``one`` and ``two``, and naturally each has its own
``.git`` directory.

To create a new weld, we must first write an XML file describing it.
For instance, we might create a file called ``frank.xml`` containing the
following:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" ?>
  <weld name="frank">
    <origin uri="file://<repo_base>/fromble" />
    <base name="project124" uri="file://<repo_base>/project124"/>
      <seam base="project124" dest="124" />
    <base name="igniting_duck" uri="file://<repo_base>/igniting_duck" />
      <seam base="igniting_duck" source="one" dest="one_duck" />
      <seam base="igniting_duck" source="two" dest="two_duck" />
  </weld>

This says that:

1. The name of the weld is ``frank``
2. The remote repository for the weld is (will be) ``file://<repo_base>/fromble``
3. The weld will contain two bases:

   a. The first base is called ``project124``, and its remote repository is
      ``file://<repo_base>/project124`` - in other words, it's the first of
      the two repositories we have already been introduced to at the start of
      this chapter.

      Note that the name we give the base does not have to match the
      repository name (although it probably normally will).

   b. The second base is called ``igniting_duck``, and it is the second
      remote repository from above.

4. The ``project124`` base will provide a single seam in the weld. The source
   directory is not specified, so this will be the entire content of the base.
   The seam will be put into the weld as directory ``124``

5. The ``igniting_duck`` base will provide two seams in the weld. The
   base directory called ``one`` will be stored in the weld as
   ``one-duck``, and the base directory called ``two`` will be stored in the
   weld as ``two-duck``. Any other directories in the base will not be added
   to the weld.

.. note:: Why use XML?

   We did consider using Python, but felt that given the highly declarative
   nature of the information described, the number of opportunities for
   self-mutilation was just too high.

   And because all the best shell scripts parse XML, we chose that.

Once we've got the XML file, we can use ``weld init``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir fromble
  $ cd fromble
  $ weld init ../frank.xml
  > git init
  > git add fromble/.weld/welded.xml .gitignore
  > git remote rm origin
  > git remote add origin file://<repo_base>/fromble
  > git commit --allow-empty --file /tmp/weldcommitYp7JZ2
  Weld initialised OK.

to create an empty weld:

.. image:: images/fromble_empty.png

.. We could have shown a weld shape that matches later on
.. .. image:: images/fromble_L_shaped.png

.. or even the same with an empty bases area
.. .. image:: images/fromble_empty_bases.png

The weld contains::

  fromble/
    .git/...
    .gitignore
    .weld/
      welded.xml

(I've left out the content of the ``.git`` directory).

The ``.gitignore`` instructs git to ignore some artefacts that weld knows it will
create in the ``.weld`` directory.  
The ``.weld/welded.xml`` is a "copy" of the original ``frank.xml`` (actually,
it is produced by reading the original XML and then writing it out from the
internal datastructure, so the layout is likely to be slightly different, and
any comments will be lost, but the content should have the same effect).
Both have been committed to the weld's git repository.

To populate our weld, we need to use:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ weld pull _all
 
This clones the two remote repositories into the weld's ``.weld/builds``
directory::

  .weld/bases/project124
  .weld/bases/igniting-duck

then copies the content of those clones into the appropriate places in the
weld, and commits the new weld contents. This gives us:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_both_bases.png

Our directory structure now looks like::

  fromble/
    .git/...
    .gitignore
    .weld/
      bases/
        igniting_duck/
          .git/...
          one/
            <source-code ign-1>
          two/
            <source-code ign-2>
        project124/
          .git/...
          one/
            <source-code 124-1>
          two/
            <source-code 124-2>
      counter
      welded.xml
    124/
      one/
        <source-code 124-1>
      two/
        <source-code 124-2>
    one-duck/
      <source-code ign-1>
    two-duck/
      <source-code ign-2>

Here we can see that in ``.weld/bases`` are the clones of the two remote
packages (our "bases"), each with its own ``.git`` directory. A normal user
will never interact with these, and strictly speaking they are not part of the
weld.

We can also see, at the top level of ``fromble``, that we now have three
source directories: ``124``, ``one-duck`` and ``two-duck``. These are checked
into the weld's git repository, and correspond to the seams described in the
XML file. Thus the weld source directory ``124`` corresponds to all of the
``project124`` base, whilst the two directories in the ``igniting_duck`` base
have been split into separate (in this case top-level) directories in the
weld, just as the XML file described.

Now we've got our weld set up, we can create a bare repository for it in the
normal manner - in this case:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pushd <repo-base>
  $ mkdir fromble
  $ cd fromble
  $ git init --bare
  $ popd

and push to it (``weld init`` set up the URI in the XML file as the origin
remote, so this "should just work"):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git push master origin

so we now have three remote repositories:

.. image:: images/fromble_repo.png
.. image:: images/project124_repo.png
.. image:: images/igniting_duck_repo.png

Using the weld just needs git
=============================
Another user can now clone the weld directly:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd ~/work
  $ git clone file://<repo_base>/fromble

which gives them the weld with its seams:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_no_bases.png

This new weld has the following directory structure::

  fromble/
    .git/...
    .gitignore
    .weld/
      counter
      welded.xml
    124/
      one/
        <source-code 124-1>
      two/
        <source-code 124-2>
    one-duck/
      <source-code ign-1>
    two-duck/
      <source-code ign-2>

.. note:: In normal use of a weld, there is no ``.weld/bases`` directory.
   The bases are not part of the weld itself, they will only be retrieved if
   the user runs a weld command that needs them.

The user can work on the content of the weld as they need, pushing to and
pulling from the weld's remote repository with git in the normal manner.

Using ``weld`` commands on the weld may pull bases
==================================================
The ``weld`` command line tool will download (clone or update) the bases when
it needs to. For instance, some queries need access to the base. In particular:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ weld query base project124

will clone project124 into ``.weld/bases/``, giving us:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_base_project124.png

or::

  fromble/
    .git/...
    .gitignore
    .weld/
      bases/
        project124/
          .git/...
          one/
            <source-code 124-1'>
          two/
            <source-code 124-2'>
      counter
      welded.xml
    124/
      one/
        <source-code 124-1>
      two/
        <source-code 124-2>
    one-duck/
      <source-code ign-1>
    two-duck/
      <source-code ign-2>

Note that the source code in the project124 base may be different than
that in the corresponding seams (shown here as ``<source-code 124-1'>`` versus
``<source-code 124>``) - which is exactly what the query needs to know.

If we decided to update the weld with any changes made in the remote
igniting_duck repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ weld pull igniting_duck
  
then this would also necessitate pulling the base:

.. image:: images/fromble_with_both_bases.png

In this case, the source code in the weld would be updated to match that in
the igniting_duck base::

  fromble/
    .git/...
    .gitignore
    .weld/
      bases/
        igniting_duck/
          .git/...
          one/
            <source-code ign-1'>
          two/
            <source-code ign-2'>
        project124/
          .git/...
          one/
            <source-code 124-1'>
          two/
            <source-code 124-2'>
      counter
      welded.xml
    124/
      one/
        <source-code 124-1>
      two/
        <source-code 124-2>
    one-duck/
      <source-code ign-1'>
    two-duck/
      <source-code ign-2'>

Changing a base or seam
=======================
At the moment, altering the content of the weld, as described by the XML file,
needs some care.

For instance, if we edited the XML file to change name of the seam
``one_duck`` to ``one_goose``:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" ?>
  <weld name="frank">
    <origin uri="file://<repo_base>/fromble" />
    <base name="project124" uri="file://<repo_base>/project124"/>
      <seam base="project124" dest="124" />
    <base name="igniting_duck" uri="file://<repo_base>/igniting_duck" />
      <seam base="igniting_duck" source="one" dest="one_goose" />
      <seam base="igniting_duck" source="two" dest="two_duck" />
  </weld>

and did:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git mv one_duck one_goose

(one day, weld may provide a command to do those together for you)
then we would have:

.. image:: images/fromble_one_goose.png

and because we have done *both* of those things, ``weld pull``, ``weld push``
and all the other weld commands would recognise that the base directory
``igniting_duck/one`` is now related to the weld seam ``one_goose``.

Things to remember not to do in a world of welds
================================================
Do not use git submodules in bases, as weld will not preserve them.

Do not use commit messages that start "X-WeldState:", as weld uses such for
its own purposes.

Do not use branches that start "weld-", as weld uses such for its own purposes
(and is not very careful in checking if you're on an offending branch, it just
looks to see if the name starts with "weld-").

Do not change the name of the ``origin`` remote of a weld, as the weld command
assumes that ``origin`` is the origin remote it should use.
