Using weld with muddle
======================

Weld was written with the intent of being muddle-compatible.

A normal muddle build tree looks something like the following::

  <project>
    .muddle/
    src/
      builds/
        .git/
        01.py
      base/
        kernel
          .git/
          <lots of source code>
      <and so on>

A muddle build tree set up for use with weld instead looks like::

  <project>
    .git/
    .gitignore
    .muddle/
    .weld/
    src/
      builds/
        01.py
      base/
        kernel
          <lots of source code>
      <and so on>

As you can see, there is now a single ``.git`` directory at the top of the
muddle source tree, as well as a ``.weld`` directory, and a ``.gitignore``
file. The ``.git`` directories that would have been present in the ``src``
directories have gone away - they are not needed in this setup.

The toplevel ``.git`` directory manages the entire source code tree.

The ``.gitignore`` file tells git to ignore various things, including the
muddle ``.muddle``, ``obj``, ``install`` and ``deploy`` directories.

Typically, such a tree would be set up by doing something like::

  $ git clone ssh://git@example.com//opt/projects/99/weld weld
  $ cd weld
  $ muddle init weld+ssh://git@example.com//opt/projects/99/weld builds/01.py

after which one can do ``muddle build _all`` and so on in the traditional
manner.

Use of the ``weld+`` mechanism in ``muddle init`` tells muddle *not* to allow
``muddle pull`` and the like to do anything - the muddle VCS commands are not
currently aware of how welds work, and so are disabled by this means. Instead,
just use git in the normal manner.

.. note:: It is possible that muddle may become more "weld aware" in the
   future, but to be honest the current mechanism seems like a sensible
   first approach, and may be the correct way to handle this in the long term
   as well.

Setting up a muddle build tree for use as a weld is addressed in a later
chapter.
