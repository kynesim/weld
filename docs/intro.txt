Why weld?
=========

Weld is meant to make it easier to manage the verson control of projects with
a moderate to large number of packages. A typical example would be the sources
needed to build a Linux system, which might typically contain:

* linux itself
* busybox for the shell and basic command line utilities
* a bootloader
* some kernel modules
* some /etc files
* audio and video support (alsalib, libvorbis, gstreamer, etc.)
* and so on

There are two traditional ways to organise the version control for such a
project:

1. One package per repository
2. One repository for the world

.. note:: *Pretty pictures to come at some later stage*

One package per repository
--------------------------
In this approach, each package is put into its own repository (or may,
sometimes, be retrieved from the "outside world" repository from which it
originates - this has obvious problems if the internet connection to the
outside world goes down).


The advantages of this approach are:

* it is very easy to relate the local copy of a package back to its
  upstream/external version, even if they are not both using the same version
  control system (e.g., local in git, remote in mercurial or subversion)

* it is easy to keep track of licensing issues, and other such per-package
  responsibilies, because each package is clearly atomic

On the other hand:

* some form or meta system must be used to decide which packages are required
  by the particular system that is being built - this is one of the reasons
  that muddle_ was first started

* it is hard to make and maintain a coherent change across multiple packages,
  because there is no linkage at all between the changes in each individual
  package

* for new software, a decision to split into packages at the wrong granularity
  (so either too much code in one large package, or too many small packages
  that are actually tightly integrated) can lead to awkward code management
  later on

* cloning many small packages is slower than cloning one larger package

One repository for the world
----------------------------
In this approach, the project as-a-whole has a single repository. Individual
packages are imported into this repository, in some appropriate workflow.

  For instamce, one might have an import branch for the project, named after
  its version ("import-busybox-1.2.1"), and once the new version of the
  package is working, this would be merged back into the main tree.

  Alternatively, perhaps, one might have a long-running package specific branch
  ("package-busybox") into which new versions of the package are periodically
  copied, tagged with the version number, and then integrated/merged back into
  the main tree.

  The actual mechanism used is not particularly pertinent to this discussion,
  but we know of people who have good mechanisms in place for handling this
  sort of repository organisation.

The advantages of this approach are:

* it is very clear what the code being used for the project is - it is that
  code which is in the repository

* a change can be made across several packages as an individual change

On the other hand:

* it is harder to reason about individual packages when they are all "mashed
  together" into one place

* it is harder to send changes upstream to the original package repositories
  when changes to an individual package are not separated out

* if a package is used in two "mega" repositories, but some of the changes (or
  perhaps just some of the information in commit messages) may not be shared
  between the two, then moving those changes from one "mega" repository to the
  original package and thence to the other "mega" repository needs careful
  management

Or there's weld
---------------
Weld attempts to make it reasonably simple to have something of both worlds.

One VCS is chosen (git) to restrict the complexity of the problem.

The normal user gets to work in a single large repository, using git, and
should mostly be able to ignore the rest of weld.

Setting up a weld in the first place, and relating it to the individual
repositories that provide its packages, is regarded as a more expert task, and
for this the ``weld`` commandline tool is provided.

A little more detail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Broadly, the normal user will ``git clone`` a weld (a single large repository)
and work within that as with any other body of source code, using the normal
``git`` tools to branch/commit/push/pull as required. The intention is that a
"normal" user just sees a "mega" repository, and works with it as such.

A project then needs one or more weld managers, who set the weld up in the
first place, and curate pushing changes back to individual repositories as and
when it becomes necessary, using "weld push" and "weld pull".

Can I use it with muddle?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, and we shall explain that in its own section.
