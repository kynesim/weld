Still to do
===========

The following is the current known "to do" list. This is above and beyond any
list of issues on the google code site.

Branch, tag, commit support for seams
=====================================
Priority: high

The weld XML file allows specifying a branch, tag or revision (commit id?) for
a seam. 

* It is not defined what happens if you specify more than one. Ideally this
  would not be allowed, and the user would be told so.
* I'm not sure what, if any, of the code takes notice of these. ``push``
  certainly doesn't. This needs fixing.

This is the most important thing to fix, and must be thoroughly tested.

XML file format
===============
Priority: medium

The current XML file is laid out as::

  <base name=A ... />
  <seam base=A ... />

and so on, where the seams for a base must occur after the base entity.

Would we be better with a "more traditional" layout like::

  <base name=A ... >
      <seam ... />
  </base>

which removes the need for the implicit ordering.

If we go for this change, we should add a "version" attribute to the <weld>
entity, and make this ``<weld name=XXX version=2>`` so that we can continue
to support old format files.

  (We *could* actually detect both styles of file by inspection, and
  support them that way, even allowing mixed format (!) files, but using
  a version number feels cleaner.)

Base and seam commands
======================
Priority: medium

Adding, deleting and renaming seams (and bases) is fiddly. We should probably
provide some commands to bundle up all the actions necessary. For instance:

* ``weld add base <base_name> <uri>`` - adds the base to the XML file, clones
  it into the "bases" directory (so the user can inspect it to figure out seam
  names).
* ``weld delete base <base_name>`` - removes the base and all its seams from
  the XML file, deletes its clone from the "bases" directory if it is there,
  deletess all the seams from the weld.
* ``weld add seam <base_name> <seam_name> <from-dir> <to-dir>`` - add the seam
  to the XML file (the base must already exist), and set up the seam. Doesn't
  do a ``git commit`` - that's up to the user.
* ``weld delete seam <base_name> <seam_name>`` - removes the seam from the XML
  file, and removes its directory from the weld. Again, doesn't do a ``git
  commit``.
* ``weld rename seam <base_name> <old_seam_name> <new_seam_name>``

Since creating the initial weld means writing an XML file, maybe we should
also provide ``weld init --empty <weld-name> <uri>`` to create a weld with a
minimal XML file - the above ``weld add`` commands can then be used to
populate it with something more interesting.

Technically, we can manage with just those, but it's probably also friendly to
provide:

* ``weld move seam <base_name> <seam_name> <old_to_dir> <new_to_dir>``
* ``weld rename seam <base_name> <old_seam_name> <new_seam_name>``

and maybe some others as becomes evident with time.

Weld origin URI
===============
Priority: medium

Should we be checking this against the *actual* origin that we are using for
the weld (i.e., check the origin URI declared in the XML file against the
origin that git is using)?

What commands should check it, and what should they do if the values disagree?

Weld pull and push common code
==============================
Priority: medium

There is some common code between weld push and weld pull (pylint notices a
small amount of it).

Moreover, it is possible that the "use ``git ls-files to find files and then
copy them`` approach used by weld push might be applicable in weld pull as
well.

Furthermore, weld push uses a ``pushing/`` directory to keep its temporary
files local - again, weld pull could do the same with a ``pulling/``
directory. This has the advantage that a partially completed push or pull is
resumable over a system reboot (when the ``/tmp`` files would be deleted).

Command line
============
Priority: low

* ``weld -h`` could be more informative
* ``weld help`` should be paged (as with muddle and git), and the formatting
  could be better.
* ``weld help <command>`` should be implemented
* Command line switches that only apply to one or two commands should not be
  general (I'm thinking of ``-tuple`` and ``-edit`` particularly)

Weld push commit message content
================================
Priority: low

The commit message (in the base) from ``weld push`` takes the form::

    X-Weld-State: Pushed igniting_duck from weld frank
    
    Changes were (in summary, topmost was applied last)
    
    f0e6ceb Remove the earlier trailing comment
    f00c9fc Add more trailing comments across the bases and to the weld
    335718e One-duck: Also build one-duck, same as one
    a75b292 One-duck: Add a comment to the end of the Makefile

* The header line is an ``X-Weld-State: Pushed`` line, in a different format
  from that used in the weld. It could be argued that it should

  a. not be an ``X-Weld-State`` line (although I don't think it can ever
     "escape" back into the weld and cause confusion)
  b. use a different term than ``Pushed`` (just in case it did "escape")

* This is the only place that the weld name (as taken from the XML file) is
  used (here it is ``frank``) - is it actually useful, or should we be using
  something else?

* I quite like having the short-form SHA1 commit ids in there, since they do
  relate back to the weld repository, but it could be argued that they are not
  of use.

Do remember that it is always possible to do ``weld push --edit`` and edit
this text before it is committed.

* Should we make ``--edit`` the default, and provide a ``--no-edit`` switch
  as well?

Output levels
=============
Priority: low

We are probably still outputting too much text when ``--verbose`` is not
specified.

We may be outputting too much or the wrong text when ``--verbose`` *is*
specified.

I suspect we are not always outputting appropriate text (in order to be
useful) when something goes wrong.

All of these need consideration.

(Over) use of git porcelain
===========================
Ideally we would use the git plumbing more, and git porcelain less, since
the output of git porcelain is (in general) allowed to be a moving target.

Weld name
=========
Priority: low

What is the weld name used for, if anything?
