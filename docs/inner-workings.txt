How weld pull and weld push work
================================

How "weld pull" does its stuff
------------------------------
*Obviously, the code is the final word on what happens, but this is intended
as reasonable background.*

Remember, "weld pull" updates its idea of the bases, and then updates the
seams in the weld "to match".

  The main code for this is in ``welded/pull.py``

The very short form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We make sure we have a current copy of the base (in ``.weld/bases``), copy
across the changes for each seam in that base to our weld, and commit with
an ``X-Weld-State: Merged`` message.

* The local copy of the base is updated, but is not otherwise changed.
* The relevant seams in the weld are updated to match the equivalent
  directories in the base.

The short form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Check it's safe to do a ``weld pull``
* Update the copy of the base in ``.weld/bases``
* Find the last time ``weld pull`` or ``weld push`` was done for this base
  - this is the synchronisation point.
* Determine which seams have been added/removed/changed in comparison to the
  newly update base. If nothing has changed, then there is nothing to do.
* If there are deleted seams, delete them in the weld. If there are added
  seams, add them in the weld, by copying their files across. If there are
  changed seams, then replay the appropriate changes in the weld.
* Commit with an ``X-Weld-State: Merged`` message.

In detail
~~~~~~~~~
So we're pulling a base

  (You can also pull multiple bases at once, by giving multiple base names on
  the command line, or use ``weld pull _all`` to pull all bases, but these
  both just work by doing this whole sequence for each base in turn. Note that
  this can be more confusing, for instance if the Nth base requires remedial
  action to take to "finish" it, at which point you have to fix the problem,
  do ``weld finish``, and then give the original weld command again to pull
  the remaining bases.)

  (Pulling an individual seam would in theory be possible, but rather fiddly,
  and of questionable use anyway, so we'll go with just pulling bases).

Given the name of a base:

#. Weld checks that there are no local changes in the weld - specifically, it
   runs ``git status`` in the weld's base directory (the directory containing
   the ``.weld`` directory). If there are any files in the weld that could be
   added with ``git add`` or committed with ``git commit``, then it will
   refuse to proceed, suggesting that the user commit or stash the changes
   first.

   It also checks whether:

   * the user is part way through an unfinished ``weld pull`` or ``weld push``
   * the weld could be updated with ``git pull`` (it looks at the remote
     repository to determine this)
   * the current branch is a weld-specific branch (starting with ``weld-``).

   and refuses to proceeed if any of those is true (this is essentially what
   ``weld status`` does, so you can do it beforehand as well).

#. It finds the last time that ``weld pull`` or ``weld push`` was done for
   this base, by looking for the most recent commit with an ``X-Weld-State:
   Merged <base-name>`` or ``X-Weld-State: Pushed <base-name>`` message. If
   there isn't  one (i.e., this is the first ``weld pull`` or ``weld push``
   for this weld), then it uses the ``X-Weld-State: Init`` commit instead.

       For ``weld pull`` we want to know the last time our base was
       synchronised with the weld as a whole. Since both ``weld pull`` and
       ``weld push`` do this, we can use either as the relevant place to work
       from.

#. Weld makes sure its copy of the base is up-to-date:

   a. If it doesn't yet have a clone of the base, it does::

         cd .weld/bases
         git clone <base-repository> <base>
         cd <base>
         git pull

   b. If it does have a clone of the base, it does::

         cd .weld/bases/<base>
         git pull

   In either case, it notes the HEAD commit of the base.

#. It determines which (if any) seams have been deleted, changed or added in
   the weld (with respect to the now up-to-date base). If all of those lists
   are empty, there is nothing to do, and the ``weld pull`` for this base is
   finished.

#. It branches the weld. The branch point is the synchronisation commit that
   was found earlier (the last ``weld pull`` or ``weld push`` commit, or else
   the Init commit).

       (The branch name used is chosen to be unique to this repository, and
       is currently of the form "weld-merge-<commit-id>-<index>", where
       <commit-id> is the first 10 characters of the synchronisation commits
       SHA1 id, and <index> is chosen to make the branch unique in case that
       is not enough.)

#. It then:

   * deletes any deleted seams
   * modifies any modified seams
   * adds any added seams

   within that branch.

   Deleting a seam is easy - it just means deleting the appropriate directory.

   Adding a seam just copies the directory structure for that seam across
   from the base into the correct place in the weld.

   Modifying a seam uses ``git diff`` to determine the appropriate changes in
   the base, and then replays them in the weld.

     .. note:: *TODO* It occurs to me that the technique use in ``weld push``
        might be more efficient than this last, if it turns out to be usable -
        I'd need to think on this further. (Tibs)

#. It writes ``.weld/complete.py`` and ``.weld/abort.py``, which can later be
   used by the ``weld finish`` and ``weld abort`` commands if necessary (and
   which will be deleted if the ``weld pull`` of this base doesn't need user
   interaction).

#. It merges the original branch (typically ``master``) onto this temporary
   branch. This will commonly "just work", but if anything goes wrong, the
   ``weld pull`` stops with a return code of 1 and a message of the form::

        <merge error message>
        Merge failed
        Either fix your merges and then do 'weld finish',
        or do 'weld abort' to give up.

#. If the merge onto the branch succeeded, or if the user fixes problems and
   then does ``weld finish``, then the ``complete.py`` script is run, which:

   a. changes back to the original branch
   b. calculates the difference between this branch and the temporary branch
      on which we did our merge
   c. applies that patch to this original branch
   d. makes sure that any changed files are added to the git index (it does
      this over the entire weld, but that should be OK because nothing else
      should be changing the weld whilst we're busy)
   e. commits this whole operation using an appropriate ``X-Weld-State: Merged
      <base-name>`` message.
   f. deletes the ``complete.py`` and ``abort.py`` scripts

   At the moment, this doesn't delete the temporary/working branch (which will
   show as a loop if you look in gitk). Future versions of weld may do so
   as part of the "complete" phase, but during the current active development
   it's thought to be useful to leave the branch visible.

#. If the merge didn't succeed, and the user chooses to do ``weld abort``,
   then the ``abort.py`` script is run, which:

   * switches back to the original branch
   * deletes the temporary/working branch
   * deletes the ``complete.py`` and ``abort.py`` scripts

Also note that the ``weld-`` branches are always meant to be local to the
current repository - they're not meant to be pushed anywhere else.

Not having those "remotes/origin/weld-" branches
------------------------------------------------
If you do a ``weld pull`` and then do a ``git push`` of the weld, in general
the transient branches will not be propagated to the weld's remote.

However, if you clone directly from a "checked out" weld (rather than from a
bare repository), then by default all branches are cloned, which is (a)
untidy, and (b) mak cause future working branches to have the same name as
earlier (remote) working branches.

If you have git version 1.7.10 or later, then you can instead clone a
"working" weld using::

  git clone --single-branch <weld-directory>

to retrieve (in this case) just ``master`` (or use ``-b <branch`` to name a
specific branch).

Of course, unfortunately, if you later do a ``git pull``, then the branches
will be fetched for you at that stage, so it's not a perfect solution. But
then maybe you shouldn't clone a "checked out" weld.

How "weld push" works
---------------------
*Obviously, the code is the final word on what happens, but this is intended
as reasonable background.*

Again, we're only going to look at doing "weld push" on a single base - the
command line will take more than one base name, or the magic ``_all``, but
we'll ignore that here.

  The main code for this is in ``welded/push.py``

The very short form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We make sure we have a current copy of the base (in ``.weld/bases``), copy
across the changes for each seam in that base from our weld to the base,
commit them all as one change with an ``X-Weld-State: Pushed`` message, and
push to the base's origin. We also add an empty ``X-Weld-State: Pushed``
commit in the weld, as a marker of when the ``weld push`` happened.

* The base is updated to match its seams in the weld, and pushed to its remote.
* The weld is marked with when the push happened.

The short form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Check it's safe to do a ``weld push``
* Update the copy of the base in ``.weld/bases``
* Determine the last ``weld push`` for this base
* For each seam, work out which files have changed (added, removed, changed)
  in the weld, since that last ``weld push``
* Use ``rsync`` to make the files in (the corresponding directory in) the
  base match
* Commit that in the base, and push it to the base's remote
* Add a corresponding ``X-Weld-State: Pushed`` commit in the weld

Remember that only seams that are currently "named" in the weld are pushed,
since they're the only seams that are of interest "now" - if the user wanted
to push changes to a seam that is not currently in use, then they should have
done it when it was in use.

In detail
~~~~~~~~~
So doing ``weld push`` for a given base name works as follows:

#. Weld checks that there are no local changes in the weld - specifically, it
   runs ``git status`` in the weld's base directory (the directory containing
   the ``.weld`` directory). If there are any files in the weld that could be
   added with ``git add`` or committed with ``git commit``, then it will
   refuse to proceed, suggesting that the user commit or stash the changes
   first.

   It also checks whether:

   * the user is part way through an unfinished ``weld pull`` or ``weld push``
   * the weld could be updated with ``git pull`` (it looks at the remote
     repository to determine this)
   * the current branch is a weld-specific branch (starting with ``weld-``).

   and refuses to proceeed if any of those is true (this is essentially what
   ``weld status`` does, so you can do it beforehand as well).

#. Weld makes sure its copy of the base is up-to-date:

   a. If it doesn't yet have a clone of the base, it does::

         cd .weld/bases
         git clone <base-repository> <base>
         cd <base>
         git pull

   b. If it does have a clone of the base, it does::

         cd .weld/bases/<base>
         git pull

#. It finds the last time that ``weld push`` was done for this base, by
   looking for the most recent commit with an ``X-Weld-State: Pushed
   <base-name`` message. If there isn't one (i.e., this is the first ``weld
   push`` for this weld), then it uses the ``X-Weld-State: Init`` commit
   instead.

      Why do we use the last ``weld push``, and not the last ``weld push``
      *or* ``weld pull``?
     
      Consider the following "pseudo git log"::
     
        6   +   change B to a file in base <fred>
        5   o   X-Weld-State: Merged <fred>/...
        4   -   a change to some irrelevant file(s)
        3   +   change A to a file in base <fred>
        2   o   X-Weld-State: Pushed <fred>/...
        1   x   some common commit
     
      So we last did ``weld pull`` at commit 5, and the weld thus contains all
      the changes from base <fred> up to that point.
     
      However, we last did a ``weld push`` at commit 2, which means that
      changes 3 and 6 have still to be applied to base <fred>. But change 3 is
      before our last ``weld pull``, so we definitely want the last ``push``.
     
      .. note:: Remember: ``weld pull`` updates the base from its remote, and
         then brings any changes therein into our weld. It does not propagate
         any changes in the weld back to the base.

#. Weld looks up the current seams being used for this base. This tells it
   which directories (in the weld and in the base) it is interested in.

#. It looks up all of the changes in the weld since the synchronisation point
   (using ``git log --one-line``) and remembers them.

   If there aren't any, it has finished.

#. It trims out any ``X-Weld-State`` commits from that list, and remembers
   *it*.

   Again, if there are no changes (left), then it has finished.

#. As an aid during development (so this may go away later on), it tags the
   synchronisation commit, using a tag name of the form
   ``weld-last-<base-name>-sync-<commit-id>``, where <commit-id> is the first
   10 characters of its SHA1 commit id.

#. In the base, it branches at the synchronisation point (remember,
   ``X-Weld-State`` commit messages record the equivalent commit id in the
   base as well), using a branch name of the form
   "weld-pushing-<commit-id>-<index>".

#. We then update the branch in the base:

   For each seam that the base currently has in our weld:

   1. We use ``git ls-files`` in the appropriate seam in the weld to find out
      which files git is managing.
   2. We do the same in the corresponding directory in the base.
   3. For files which the seam (in the weld) has, but the base does not, we
      do ``git rm``. We commit that change.
   4. For all the other files in the seam, we just copy them over into the
      base (actually, we use ``rsync``). It is, of course, quite likely that
      many of them won't have changed, but that's OK. Then we ``git add`` all
      of the files we've copied, in the base, and commit that change as well.

   .. note:: Any seams that are not in the weld are, by definition, not of
      interest to us. Even if they were in the weld at the last
      synchronisation point, the fact they aren't *now* means we are not
      interested in any (possible) intermediate changes - if we cared about
      such changes, we should have done ``weld push``  then.

#. We prepare a final commit message, and write out the ``.weld/complete.py``
   and ``.weld/abort.py`` files.

#. We run the ``complete.py`` file to finish off our ``weld push``. This:

   * sets the merging indicator (touches a file in the ``.weld/pushing``
     directory)
   * in the base, if the merging indicator is not set, merges the original
     branch (normally "master") into our working branch - this should just
     proceed with no problems
   * still in the base, merges that back into the original branch
   * still in the base, commits the change using the saved commit message

       The commit message has a summary of the corresponding commits from the
       weld, as output by ``git log --one-line``.

       If the user specified ``weld push -edit``, then they get the chance to
       edit the message before it is used.

   * notes the new HEAD commit id in the base
   * adds an ``X-Weld-State: Pushed <base-name>/<commit-id>`` commit to the
     weld, using that commit id (this is, of course, notionally an empty
     commit).
   * deletes the merging indicator and the saved commit message.

If something did go wrong, then ``weld finish`` just does that last item again
(which is why we need the merging indicator). ``weld abort`` deletes the
working branch, and then deletes the merging indicator and saved commit
message.
