The weld documentation: Sphinx and ReadTheDocs
==============================================

Pre-built documentation
-----------------------
For your comfort and convenience, a pre-built version of the weld
documentation is available at:

    http://weld.readthedocs.org/

This is hosted by `Read the Docs`_, who are wonderful people for providing
such a facility. The documentation should get rebuilt on each push to the
repository, which means that it should always be up-to-date.

.. _`Read the Docs`: http://readthedocs.org

Building the documentation
--------------------------
The weld documentation is built using Sphinx_.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

As said above, the easiest way to get the documentation is via `Read the
Docs`_, but if you want to build a copy yourself, then all you need to do is
install Sphinx_, and use the Makefile::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html
