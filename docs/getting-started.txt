=========================
Getting started with weld
=========================

As a normal user
================
If you're a normal user of weld, then there isn't much to learn.

Basically, your project documentation should tell you how to clone a weld -
for instance::

  $ git clone ssh://git@example.com//opt/projects/99/weld project99

You can then just develop in ``project99`` as normal, using git to handle
version control as you would for any other project.

As a muddle user
================
Your project should include documentation telling you to:

1. Clone a weld
2. ``cd`` into it and use ``muddle init`` to set it up

and then you can mostly use the build tree as a normal muddle user.

For instance::

  $ mkdir project99
  $ cd project99
  $ git clone ssh://git@example.com//opt/projects/99/weld weld
  $ cd weld
  $ muddle init weld+ssh://git@example.com//opt/projects/99/weld builds/01.py

The ``weld+`` tells muddle it is dealing with a weld, and (essentially)
disanles ``muddle push`` and ``muddle pull``. The idea is that you should just
use git directly (``git push``, ``git pull``, etc.).

For a bit more information, see the chapter on Muddle later on.
